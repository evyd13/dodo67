## Same direction? Reverse direction...?

In essence: the original Doro67 PCB needs a 'same direction' cable, while the Dodo67 PCB needs a 'reverse direction' cable. This is because the Unified Daughterboard specification uses the latter.

***HOWEVER, the first version of the Dodo67 PCB, which was sold by MyKeyboard, uses a reverse direction cable.***

## What's the hole for?
The hole next to the breakout pins (which you can solder a wire to) is for cable relief! Use a zip tie to secure it to the daughterboard and prevent it from moving around.

## A note on PCB thickness
This daughterboard is intended to be 2.0mm thick. This is so you don't need the washers like the original Dodo67 daughterboard did. You can use it in 1.6mm as well, but remember to use the washers in that case!
